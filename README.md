In 1979 [Factory Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_Records) released their 10th album [Unknown Pleasures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures) by Joy Division. The artwork is credited to both the band & [Peter Saville](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Saville_(graphic_designer)>). The album cover uses an image of radio waves from pulsar [CP 1919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_1919). The background is black (instead of white) because Peter Saville said "I was convinced that it was just sexier in black". It is considered one of "the best albums of all time".

I'm obsessed with this album, musically & artistically. So much so that for some time I've been trying to make an app that would use the album song's as the data for the graph. I've treid before and hit walls. Recently I've started working on it again and with some help from [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/), a path was shown. If you're also a nerd like me, I left a ton of notes in the code for you!
